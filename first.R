## First R Script
## In this R script you will learn general syntax and how to execute from a script file
## first things first, any line that starts with a # is ignored by R and is for
## humans reading the script only; i.e. a comment. So pay special attention
## to this text as it has instructions and information about the script itself
## to help you understand what is going on.
## Ok, lets jump into learning R and RStudio
## To start with, lets execute a single line of code. In Rstudio if you have a script
## open (like this one) you can put the cursor on a line you want to execute and hit
## <ctrl> <enter> together (for macs use command-enter)
## Try it now on the line below

print("Hello World!")

### after you hit enter you should see in the window below 
##  print("Hello World!")
## [1] "Hello World!"
